# Clone of the Nike store

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a smaller copy of the Nike online store.   When creating it, I paid attention to the functionality and therefore used css bootstrapping for faster layout.  My task in this project was to teach how to work with network requests. Therefore, information about goods and their photos are stored on a remote server, and when a product is selected, a new object with the product is sent to the server and also stored in local storage. All files in the project are divided into modules. When writing JS code, a functional approach is used.
